## TODO

  * Add support for scheduled posts for Wordpress and YouTube.
  * Add support for uploading audio to Wordpress or setting audio URLs for Powerpress.
  * Add `--dry-run` argument to `publish_podcast`.
  * Add Discourse support using [pydiscourse](https://github.com/tindie/pydiscourse)
  * Use `validate` and a ConfigSpec to validate the `.ini`. This may not
  play nicely with string interpolation.

### ffmeg filters

Perhaps adding an option to overlay a sound wave would be nifty.

  * http://video.stackexchange.com/questions/9644/how-do-i-turn-audio-into-video-that-is-show-the-waveforms-in-a-video

The folowing produces a sound wave only but doesn't overlay on the still.

    ffmpeg -i audio.wav -filter_complex showwaves=s=854x480:mode=line -i picture.png -c:v libx264 -preset fast -tune stillimage -c:a aac -strict experimental -b:a 160k -shortest -pix_fmt yuv420p video.mkv
