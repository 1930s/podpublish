## TODO

  * Add support for scheduled posts for Wordpress and YouTube.
  * Add support for uploading audio to Wordpress or setting audio URLs for Powerpress.
  * Add `--dry-run` argument to `publish_podcast`.
  * Add Discourse support using [pydiscourse](https://github.com/tindie/pydiscourse)
  * Use `validate` and a ConfigSpec to validate the `.ini`. This may not
  play nicely with string interpolation.
